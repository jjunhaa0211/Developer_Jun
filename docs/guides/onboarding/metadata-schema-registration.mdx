Prior to metadata registration, you need to [register your collection](./collection-registration.mdx).

## Add collection metadata schema

Only the project owner (wallet owner) can add a metadata schema to a collection. [See an example schema here](https://docs.x.immutable.com/docs/asset-metadata#example-metadata-schema).

Each property of the metadata schema contains the following fields:
<table>
  <thead>
  <tr>
    <th>Field</th>
    <th>Required (Default value)</th>
    <th>Value Type / Notes</th>
  </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <code>name</code>
    </td>
    <td>yes</td>
    <td>text</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <code>type</code>
    </td>
    <td>no (<code>"text"</code>)</td>
    <td><a href='https://docs.x.immutable.com/docs/asset-metadata#property-type-mapping'>See Property Type Mapping</a></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <code>filterable</code>
    </td>
    <td>no (<code>false</code>)</td>
    <td>boolean. If set to <code>true</code>, then the particular metadata's <code>name</code> will show up in the filters that are used by marketplaces and other ecosystem projects.</td>
  </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

Example payload:
```json title="Metadata Schema sample"
{
  "metadata": [
    {
      "name": "some-metadata-name",
      "type": "discrete",
      "filterable": true
    },
    {
      "name": "rare",
      "type": "boolean",
      "filterable": true
    },
    {
      "name": "image_url"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Edit metadata schema
To add missing attributes to your collection's metadata schema that were not submitted in the original request, you can [execute this call](https://github.com/immutable/imx-examples/blob/main/src/admin/update-metadata-by-name.ts) multiple times. Just add the missing attributes and they will be appended.

Submitting the same metadata schema attribute will cause the error:
```json title="Error that happens when submitting the same metadata schema"
{"code":"metadata_key_already_exists","message":"Metadata key(s) already exist"}
```

:::caution Metadata refreshing requires support
While you can register your own collections and metadata on Ropsten, you **cannot** execute a metadata refresh yourself. 

To refresh metadata changes, you need to [contact support](https://support.immutable.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and identify the tokens that need to be re-crawled, and the updates that have been made to them.

Requests may take up to 2 business days (AEST).
:::

## Other attributes
You can update the "filterable" attribute of a metadata schema property.

**Expensive API call on "filterable": true**
This API call may take a few seconds to a few minutes as it will trigger a re-scan of all the assets for the to get the up to date the filter values.
 
You can also edit the "type" attribute of a metadata schema property.

**Filterable text is not allowed**
If passing both "filterable": true and the "type": "text", this API call will return an error. This error will also be triggered when passing "filterable": true and the metadata "type" is already "text".
