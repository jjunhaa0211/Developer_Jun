## Introduction

The [Immutable X documentation website](https://docs.x.immutable.com) is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/). Docusaurus is a static-site generator built with [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [MDX](https://mdxjs.com). It builds a single-page application (SPA) that's SEO friendly. But you don't need to learn React to be able to write documentation or contribute to it! All docs are written in [Markdown](https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features).

### Tech Stack

- [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/)

### Installation

1. Clone the repo

```sh
git clone https://github.com/immutable/imx-docs/
```

2. Install dependencies

## Writing Documentation

Read the [Contributors Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) for more details

### Add or edit page
Adding a new page is simple! Identify the section under which your new page goes inside the `docs` folder, and then create a markdown file in that folder. For example, if you want to add a new page to the `Components` guide, you'd create a new page under `docs/guides/Components`. Ensure that the new page has a section at the top of the page like below, where you can specify the name of the article, the slug by which you can navigate to it, an exerpt and the page's position in the sidebar.

```
---
title: 'Link.buy'
slug: '/link-buy2'
excerpt: "Link can now be used to kick off buy flows containing multiple order ID's"
sidebar_position: 4
---
```

Refer to the [Docusaurus Documentation on creating a page](https://docusaurus.io/docs/creating-pages)

Editing is even easier:
1. Open up the page you want to edit on your browser
2. Scroll to the bottom of the page 
3. Click on `Edit this page`, and it'll take you to the file that you need to edit on GitHub. 
4. Apply your edits, and send a pull request (PR)


### Add a new Sidebar Section
If you want to add a new top level sidebar section:
1. Create a new folder under `docs`. 
2. Create a file named `_category_.json` inside the newly created folder
```json
{
    "label": "New section label",
    "position": 3
}
```
3. Create a file called `index.md` which will serve as the default page that renders when you navigate to the newly created section.
4. Add more pages to the section using the guide above.

Refer to the [Docusaurus Documentation on Sidebars](https://docusaurus.io/docs/sidebar/items)

### Add a code block

The [Docusaurus Documentation on Code Blocks](https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features/code-blocks) is excellent!

### Add a table

We use mdx to enable adding HTML based tables to our docs. In order to enable mdx on a page, ensure that it's extension is `.mdx`. Now, that page can render any react component or valid HTML. See an example of a table [here](./docs/guides/asset-management/asset-metadata.mdx)

Read more about using [MDX and React in Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features/react)

### Add an admonition

Admonitions allow us to make our docs prettier and provide our users with tips, useful information, and cautions. 

You can add an admonition using the following format:

```
:::note

Some **content** with _markdown_ `syntax`. Check [this `api`](#).

:::
```
